				<p align="justify" class="big">
				I go by Nour! After completting my Bacholer's degree in 2012, I received the <a href="https://us.fulbrightonline.org">Fulbright Scholarship</a> to continue my sudies in the US. I ended up at <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/ECE">Purdue's ECE</a>. I had (and still have) the pleasue of working with <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/~milind">Milind Kulkarni</a> during my Master's degree. We worked on developping techniques for <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3033019.3033030">Data structure-aware heap partitioning</a>.

				

				<p align="justify" class="big">
				Because I "love" cold weather and cornfields, I decided to stay for a PhD at Purdue. 
				I doubled-down on great advisers by having <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/roopsha/">Roopsha Samanta</a> as my co-adviser. We tackle the problem of parametterized verification and synthesis of dstributed systems.
